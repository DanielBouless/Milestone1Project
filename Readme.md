I remember trying to play minesweeper as a kid without a clue how to play. Basically just clicking and hoping for the best. 
This game is the same concept. Once the screen goes black you're a kid trying to get as many clicks on the screen as possible.

The point of the game is the find a little black box. Seems easy when the screen is white. Lots of contrast. 

Select your difficulty which changes the size of the black box. If you're feeling confident then bet on it! You can change the bet every round.

Once you submit your difficulty and bet, smash that start button and start clickin'.

The score is just as annoying as the game. You want to get the highest score possible because that gets added to your money bag.


The way the game was built was creating div elements and assigning an event listener. Event listeners will either change the information on the page or change colors.

Current bugs are the bets are coming through as strings so the bet gets spliced together instead of added.
